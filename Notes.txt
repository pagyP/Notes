Hello Paul,

 

Welcome to DigiCert! I had a look at your account and can see that it's already been enabled for the MVP program. I hope that as you get a feel for the DigiCert system, you come to see how DigiCert can be an asset in your professional and lab environments.

 

Your MVP Benefits include the following:

    * Free Geotrust Cloud DV certificates (note that this is the only free SSL certificate, and can be found under the “Request a Certificate" menu)

    * Rest API Access

    * Access to CertCentral 

 

We have used the GeoTrust Cloud DV cert as the default MVP product, as it’s very versatile and can support names with the Wildcard character (as well as names without).  If the Wildcard character is needed, this can simply be input into the Common Name or SAN field on the order request (ie. CN =*.domain.com).   

   

We strive to provide every customer a top-level customer service experience. If you have any concerns as you use our systems and communicate with our teams, please feel free to reach out to mvp@digicert.com.  I hope you have a great experience with DigiCert and we look forward to working with you.

 

Thanks and have a good one!

 The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or
       password. For example:

           $ git config credential.helper store
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           Username: <type your username>
           Password: <type your password>

           [several days later]
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           [your credentials are used automatically]

           Don’t worry! You can easily change this behavior and enable right-click on Ubuntu 18.04. Let me show you how to do that.
           You need to install GNOME Tweaks tool first. It is available in Ubuntu Software Center.
