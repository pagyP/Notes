# Chapter 10

## Working with Text
* The cat command (concatenate)
* View files using a pager
    *   Less and more are pagers
    * Keystrokes can be used to moved around files with less and more

## Head and Tail
*  Head and Tail
The head and tail commands are used to display only the first few or last few lines of a file, respectively (or, when used with a pipe, the output of a previous command). By default, the head and tail commands display ten lines of the file that is provided as an argument.

For example, the following command displays the first ten lines of the /etc/sysctl.conf file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cd
sysadmin@localhost:~$ head /etc/sysctl.conf
#
# /etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration file for setting system variables
# See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additional system variables
# See sysctl.conf (5) for information.
#

#kernel.domainname = example.com

# Uncomment the following to stop low-level messages on console
#kernel.printk = 3 4 1 3
Passing a number as an option will cause both the head and tail commands to output the specified number of lines, instead of the standard ten. For example to display the last five lines of the /etc/sysctl.conf file use the -5 option:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ tail -5 /etc/sysctl.conf
# Protects against creating or following links under certain conditions
# Debian kernels have both set to 1 (restricted)
# See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt
#fs.protected_hardlinks=0
#fs.protected_symlinks=0
The -n option can also be used to indicate how many lines to output. Pass a number as an argument to the option:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ head -n 3 /etc/sysctl.conf
#
# /etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration file for setting system variables
# See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additional system variables
Negative Value Option
Traditionally in UNIX, the number of lines to output would be specified as an option with either command, so -3 meant to show three lines. For the tail command, either -3 or -n -3 still means show three lines.

However, the GNU version of the head command recognizes -n -3 as show all but the last three lines, and yet the head command still recognizes the option -3 as show the first three lines.

Positive Value Option
The GNU version of the tail command allows for a variation of how to specify the number of lines to be printed. If the -n option is used with a number prefixed by the plus sign, then the tail command recognizes this to mean to display the contents starting at the specified line and continuing all the way to the end.

For example, the following displays the contents of the /etc/passwd from line 25 to the end of the file:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ nl /etc/passwd | tail -n +25
    25  sshd:x:103:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
    26  operator:x:1000:37::/root:/bin/sh
    27  sysadmin:x:1001:1001:System Administrator,,,,:/home/sysadmin:/bin/bash
Consider This

Live file changes can be viewed by using the -f option to the tail command—useful when you want to see changes to a file as they are happening.

A good example of this would be when viewing log files as a system administrator. Log files can be used to troubleshoot problems and administrators often view them "interactively" with the tail command while performing commands in a separate window.

For example, if you were to log in as the root user, you could troubleshoot issues with the email server by viewing live changes to the /var/log/mail.log log file.



## Input/Output Redirection
* Input/Output (I/O) redirection allows for command line information to be passed to different streams. Before discussing redirection, it is important to understand the standard streams.

* STDIN
Standard input, or STDIN, is information entered normally by the user via the keyboard. When a command prompts the shell for data, the shell provides the user with the ability to type commands that, in turn, are sent to the command as STDIN.

* STDOUT
Standard output, or STDOUT, is the normal output of commands. When a command functions correctly (without errors) the output it produces is called STDOUT. By default, STDOUT is displayed in the terminal window where the command is executing. STDOUT is also known as stream or channel #1.

* STDERR
Standard error, or STDERR, is error messages generated by commands. By default, STDERR is displayed in the terminal window where the command is executing. STDERR is also known as stream or channel #2.

‌⁠​​** I/O redirection allows the user to redirect STDIN so that data comes from a file and STDOUT/STDERR so that output goes to a file. Redirection is achieved by using the arrow < > characters.
